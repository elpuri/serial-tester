serial-tester
===================

A simple tester design for those times when you're just not sure
if there's something wrong with your design or the terminal software /
USB<->RS-232 converter / alignment of heavenly bodies.

The design expects a 115200bps serial connection and displayes the
received bytes on a pair of 7-segment displays on the Altera DE2 board.
